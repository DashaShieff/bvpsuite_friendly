# The solver I wanted to hug

A friendlier bvpsuite I used for my thesis project, New Methods for Optimising in Viscous Flow.

This version has a nice main script (CallBvpsuite) which you can input lots and lots of boundary conditions as an array and very long differential equations without going through the GUI.

Works with MATLAB R2020b.

The original bvpsuite can be found here: http://www.othmar-koch.org/software.html

Big Thanks to Ewa Weinmueller and to the scientific computing team at TU Wien.

Upload here as supporting documentation as this is the solver I used to solve most of my non-linear differential equations in implicit form.

The examples_paper are the equations from the TU Wien team.

The examples_masters are the equations I used in my masters thesis.
